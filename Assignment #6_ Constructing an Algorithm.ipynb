I propose these strategies to maximize exposure of corrupted robots:\n","\n","1. **Pairwise Testing:** Initially, test robots in pairs. Since uncorrupted robots always tell the truth, any pair where both robots declare the other as uncorrupted is a pair of uncorrupted robots. We can safely exclude them from further tests.\n","\n","2. **Handling Disagreements:** If a pair disagrees (one says the other is corrupted and vice versa), at least one of them must be corrupted. Keep these robots for further investigation.\n","\n","3. **Cross Verification:** After initial pairing, take robots from the disagreement pairs and test them with robots confirmed as uncorrupted. This will help isolate who is corrupted among the disagreeing pairs.\n","\n","4. **Iterative Process:** Repeat the cross-verification process, reducing the pool of potential corrupted robots each time.\n","\n","5. **Optimization:** To minimize test bed usage, use combinatorial grouping strategies where possible, and avoid retesting pairs already confirmed as uncorrupted.\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"rkzbB6CJDYQV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Problem #2: Strategy for Corrupted Robots\n","\n","As a corrupted robot, the objective is to maximize test bed usage and avoid detection.

Since the corrupted robots can communicate with eachother this should be easy to coordinate.\n","\n","2. **Collaboration:** Corrupted robots should agree on a common set of lies to maintain consistency in their accusations.\n","\n","3. **Target Isolation:** Focus on accusing a specific subset of uncorrupted robots to create a scenario where it's hard to determine who is telling the truth without extensive cross-testing.\n","\n","4. **Adaptation:** If the uncorrupted robots employ a systematic approach to testing, corrupted robots might need to adapt their strategy, possibly changing who they accuse over time to create further confusion.\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sUWsDpVqDzQA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Problem #3: Minimum Number of Corrupted Robots for Indeterminate Status\n","\n","The minimum number *K* of corrupted robots required to make it impossible to definitively prove which robot is corrupted depends on the total number of robots *N*.
