README for Assignment_9_Final_project.ipynb


--------------Notebook Overview--------------   
"Assignment_9_Final_project.ipynb" is a project designes to solve a multitude of problems.
These problems are, assignment, routing and scheduling. To solve these problems
the projekt uses Genetic Algorithm (GA). 


--------------Code Rundown--------------   
Data
Example: tasks = {...}
This section defines data related to the different problems.
Assignment problem: Tasks and employees
Distance problem: Locations and distances
Scheduling problem: Shifts and employee availability


Genetic Algorithm Function:
This function defines a genetic algorithm.


Fitness Functions for Assignment Problem:
Example: def fitness_assignment(chromosome):
Here, a fitness function for the assignment problem is defined. 
This function evaluates how close a given solution candidate is to meeting the set objectives.

Routing Problem Specific Functions:
Example: def calculate_distance(route):
Functions specific to a routing problem are defined here. 


Scheduling Problem Specific Functions:
Example: def fitness_scheduling(chromosome):
This part of the code focuses on functions related to a scheduling problem.

Enhanced Genetic Algorithm Function:
Example: def run_genetic_algorithm(...)
An enhanced version of the genetic algorithm function is defined here, 
allowing for adjustable parameters.

Prints:
Here the code can be run which will produce human-readable results and errors if any information given is faulty.
